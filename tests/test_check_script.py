"""Gates on the gate runners themselves: ``check.ps1``, ``ci.yml``, ``npm test``.

``check.ps1`` once ran its Python/docs steps in the *caller's* current
directory while anchoring only the npm steps on ``$PSScriptRoot``. Invoked by
absolute path from another checkout (an older clone, a second worktree) it
therefore lint-checked, type-checked, tested and built the docs of *that*
tree, ran the web tests of *this* tree, and exited 0 -- a verdict that
certified neither. The first two tests pin the fix: every step runs in the
repository the script lives in, whatever the caller's cwd.

``ci.yml``'s ``changed-links`` job resolves the revision to diff against. On a
push it used ``github.event.before``, which is the zero SHA for the first push
of a branch and a non-ancestor after a force push; both cases used to *skip*
the probe while the docs said the job ran on every push. The remaining tests
execute that step's actual shell script (read from the workflow, not
re-implemented) against throwaway repositories and require it to fall back to
``origin/master`` instead of skipping. When even that base contains HEAD --
the first or a force push of ``master`` itself, where ``origin/master`` *is*
HEAD and a diff against it is empty -- or when there is no ``origin/master``
at all, the step must not fall silent either: it asks the probe step to
sweep every cited URL and DOI instead, and the probe step's script is
executed here with a stub ``uv`` to show it honours that.

Both behavioural tests need an interpreter: ``pwsh`` for the PowerShell script
and a POSIX ``bash`` for the workflow step. Both are on every GitHub runner
image, and ``tests/conftest.py`` turns a skip into a failed session, so a
machine without them fails these tests loudly rather than passing by omission.
On Windows the ``bash`` on ``PATH`` is usually the WSL launcher, so the one
shipped with Git for Windows is located through ``git --exec-path``.

The last group pins ``web/package.json``'s ``test`` script, which is what
``check.ps1`` and ``ci.yml`` both reach the front-end gates through. Those
gates cannot defend their own invocation: deleting ``&& node
scripts/assert-coverage-scope.mjs`` from that one line leaves every remaining
check green, and deleting the pre-clean together with ``--coverage`` leaves
the verifier certifying the *previous* run's report. That is squarely in the
threat model the front-end gates adopted -- persisting a coverage flag into
this same ``test`` script is the bypass they exist to catch, and deleting a
gate from the chain is cheaper than editing one -- so the chain is pinned from
outside the chain, exactly as ``ci.yml`` and ``check.ps1`` already are.

Naming a stage was not enough on its own: the stages were matched by
substring, so ``vitest run --coverage.enabled=false`` satisfied the stage
called ``vitest run --coverage``, and with ``clean-coverage.mjs``'s artefact
list emptied the verifiers then certified the previous run's report. Naming
them as an ordered *subset* was not enough either -- an inserted stage was
permitted anywhere, and one that rewrote both reports took ``npm test`` to
exit 0 while vitest printed 66.66% for a gated module -- so the chain is now
pinned as an exact tuple. The same group also pins what the chain may *not*
say (no coverage override in the invocation), what npm wraps around it (no
``pretest`` / ``posttest``), what the pre-clean must delete, and that
``web/src/guards.test.ts`` -- which carries most of the front-end gate and
which nothing else in the repo reads -- still exists and still contains its
blocks.

Three pins in that group are here rather than in ``web/`` because they are
DIFF-REVIEW TRIPWIRES: each fires the moment a known wiring is written down,
which happens before the run rather than during it. A Vite plugin's ``config()``
hook rewrites the configuration vitest resolves without touching a byte of any
file the front-end guards read, and a coverage provider reached that way hands
the run's own gates a report the run wrote itself -- measured, with the whole of
``check.ps1`` exiting 0. No further layer *in the same trust domain* can settle
that: vitest, its config, its provider, the front-end gates and the artefacts
they read are all one mutable, equally-privileged checkout, and a domain like
that cannot vouch for itself (see the boundary note atop
``web/scripts/assert-coverage-scope.mjs`` and ``docs/project/status.md``).

Being in ``tests/`` is not itself that boundary, and nothing here should be read
as claiming it is: these are ordinary files in the same checkout, and a diff
that edits them is simply a bigger diff. What they do is put a price on the
WIRING, one spelling at a time: ``vitest.config.ts`` must declare no ``plugins``
and must import exactly the modules pinned here, and ``web/scripts/`` must hold
exactly the modules listed here. Each closes a way of reaching a provider; none
closes the provider, and the list is a list of the wirings that are known. The
import pin is here because without it the plugins array simply moved one import
away and took ``check.ps1`` to exit 0 with the other two silent -- measured, on
this tree.

    The aliased-directory test above covers a reparse point on the
    *directory*. This is the reparse point on the *file*, which
    asking ``$PSScriptRoot`` never sees
    at all: the directory is a perfectly ordinary directory, and only the file
    inside it is a link. Unlike a hard link there is a target to follow, so the
    script must follow it and run the full gate against the real checkout --
    refusing would be a false red on a legitimate way to install a script.

    On POSIX a symlink always creates, so a refusal there is a real failure and
    is raised as one. On Windows creating a *file* symlink needs
    ``SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege`` -- an elevated process, or Developer Mode
    -- while creating a junction needs nothing, which is why the
    aliased-directory test above is the unprivileged Windows case and this one
    is not. That asymmetry is already the stated reasoning there, and it is a threat
    statement as much as a convenience one: on Windows an actor who can plant a
    file symlink is already elevated, and an elevated actor can simply edit this
    script.

    So where Windows refuses, this warns loudly and falls back to asserting
    that the file-side resolution is still WIRED, rather than either failing the
    whole gate for an OS privilege or passing as though the case had run. Note
    what that fallback does and does not buy: the end-to-end proof is the run
    above, and on a machine that warns, only CI (and any POSIX checkout) has
    actually made it. Do not read a green run on such a machine as evidence

# --- ci.yml web-visual job --------------------------------------------------

#: The job that runs the Playwright screenshot suite. It is a job of its own
#: rather than two more steps of ``web`` because it needs a browser download and
#: system libraries the unit-test job has no use for, and because a red pixel
#: diff must be readable as "the picture changed", not as "the front-end gates
#: failed".
VISUAL_JOB = "web-visual"

#: The browser install, spelled exactly. ``--no-install`` makes npx refuse to
#: fetch a *different* Playwright from the registry when the local one is
#: missing: the browser binaries are bundled per Playwright version, so a run
#: that silently downloaded another version would compare this tree's rendering
#: against baselines drawn by a Chromium it never used. ``--with-deps`` is what
#: puts the shared libraries headless Chromium needs on the runner, and
#: ``chromium`` is the only browser the suite drives (playwright.config.ts pins
#: ``browserName: 'chromium'``), so installing the other two would only add
#: minutes.
VISUAL_BROWSER_INSTALL = "npx --no-install playwright install --with-deps chromium"

#: The gate itself: ``playwright test`` followed by
#: ``node scripts/assert-visual-run.mjs`` (web/package.json pins that pair).
VISUAL_TEST_COMMAND = "npm run test:visual"

#: The failure artefact. Playwright writes the HTML report and the actual /
#: expected / diff PNGs of every failed comparison to these two directories,
#: and they are the only way to see WHAT changed: the CI log carries a
#: pixel-count and nothing else. Paths are repository-relative because
#: ``defaults.run.working-directory`` applies to ``run:`` steps only, never to
#: a ``uses:`` step's inputs.

    """The guard spec is pinned from outside itself, as the chain is.

    ``web/src/guards.test.ts`` carries the config-source half of the coverage
    binding, the runtime-extension policy, the pragma scan, the type-only
    guard and the derivation-vs-manifest comparison. Deleting it left
    ``npm test`` green at 96 tests with an uncovered ``src/api/sneaky.mts``
    shipping (measured). By the same argument that pins the chain -- deleting
    a gate disables it as thoroughly as editing it -- the file's existence and
    its named blocks are asserted here, where deleting the guard cannot also
    delete the assertion.

    What this closes, exactly: DELETING the file, EMPTYING it, and replacing it
    with a placeholder that does not carry the anchor strings below. What it
    does NOT close: a placeholder that keeps them. The check is a substring
    search, so a file containing these names -- as ``describe`` blocks with
    empty bodies, or even in a comment -- passes it while asserting nothing.
    Read this as a tripwire on the cheap ways to remove the guard, not as a
    guarantee that the guard still works; what proves the assertions are still
    real is that they still go red, which is the business of the whole suite
    rather than of this one test.
