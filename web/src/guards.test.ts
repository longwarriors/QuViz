/**
 * Suite-integrity guards: the web counterpart of the Python conftest that
 * fails the session on any skipped test.
 *
 * Two things can make `npm run test` report green while measuring less than
 * it claims:
 *
 *   1. A committed skip / todo / focus / conditional-run modifier on a runner
 *      call in a spec. `allowOnly: false` in vitest.config.ts already refuses
 *      the focus form at run time; skips and todos are merely reported as
 *      "skipped" and do not fail the run on their own.
 *   2. A coverage pragma (the v8 / c8 / istanbul / node:coverage "ignore
 *      next|start|else", "disable|enable" comment forms) in a gated source
 *      module, which carves lines out of the per-file threshold without any
 *      test exercising them.
 *
 * Skips are gated twice, and the two layers have different jobs:
 *
 *   - The authoritative gate is `scripts/assert-no-skips.mjs`, which `npm test`
 *     runs against vitest's own JSON result file after the run. Whatever a
 *     skip was spelled as (a modifier chained through `.concurrent` or
 *     `.sequential`, a bracket-indexed modifier, a modifier destructured off
 *     the runner, an aliased runner, or a runtime call on the test context
 *     inside the test body), the runner reports it as a non-passed test, and
 *     the gate fails on any such test, any spec file the runner never visited,
 *     and any summary counter that disagrees with "everything passed". Its
 *     audit logic is exercised below with synthetic result fixtures.
 *   - The source scan in this file is the secondary guard: it cannot see every
 *     spelling (an aliased runner carrying `todo` defeats it), but when it
 *     does hit it points at the exact line, which the JSON gate cannot. It
 *     covers the chained, bracket-indexed, destructured and runtime-context
 *     forms as well as the plain `runner.modifier` one.
 *
 * Plain `node:fs`, no DOM: this walks the committed tree and greps it. The
 * patterns are assembled from fragments at runtime so this file never contains
 * the literal tokens it forbids and therefore cannot trip itself (it is a
 * `.test.ts` under src/, so it is inside its own scan).
