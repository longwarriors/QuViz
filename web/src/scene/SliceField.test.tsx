/**
 * What `SliceField` puts in the scene, asserted on the real three objects it
 * builds.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CLAIM: that the slice LOOKS right. There is no GPU in
 * this process and no frame is drawn here; the pixels are PR-8C's visual CI.
 * What is claimed is everything the picture's correctness rests on and that a
 * screenshot could not tell you anyway -- the sampling mode, the colour space,
 * the orientation of the quad, and that nothing survives unmount.
 *
 * Three of those deserve saying out loud, because they are the assertions a
 * reviewer would otherwise read as ceremony:
 *
 * **The filters.** `NearestFilter` is not a style choice. A masked texel is
 * `[0, 0, 0, 0]`; bilinear filtering would average it with its opaque
 * neighbours and produce a partially transparent texel whose RGB is a fraction
 * of a real phase colour -- i.e. it would invent a phase in the one region the
 * payload went to the trouble of saying has none.
 *
 * **The colour space.** The texels come out of `sliceColor.ts`, whose constants
 * are chosen by arithmetic defined on sRGB-encoded channels -- the WCAG
 * transfer function in sliceColor.test.ts, and a contrast ratio against the
 * scene background that only works out if the bytes are what a viewer sees. So
 * the texture is tagged sRGB, and the renderer decodes it once and encodes it
 * once, which is the identity. Tagging it `NoColorSpace` instead reads every
 * byte as a LINEAR value and encodes it on the way out, which lifted the dark
 * neutral #383838 to #818181 on screen and put the legend and the plane beside
 * it in disagreement -- the one thing this material turns tone mapping off to
 * prevent.
 *
 * **The quaternion.** Asserted by what it DOES to the plane's own axes -- local
 * +x lands on `u_axis`, +y on `v_axis`, +z on `normal` -- rather than by
 * comparing against a second `makeBasis` call. Recomputing the implementation
 * in the spec would pass just as happily with `u` and `v` swapped, which is
 * exactly the mistake that mirrors every asymmetric slice.
 *
 * Payloads are built as raw records and pushed through `parseSlicePayload`
 * rather than cast into shape, for `sliceTexture.test.ts`'s reason: a fixture
 * the contract would refuse is a fixture no renderer can ever be handed.
 *
 * Harness facts from the T0 spike this file depends on: specs cannot use JSX
 * (vitest.config.ts declares no React plugin, so esbuild compiles with the
 * classic runtime and JSX dies with "React is not defined"), and
 * `renderer.scene.findAll(...)` hands back `ReactThreeTestInstance` wrappers --
 * so assertions read `.instance` and `.type` rather than `instanceof`, which is
 * false across the test renderer's second copy of three. The default `node`
 * environment is enough: this component reads no `window`.
