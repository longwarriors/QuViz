/**
 * A slice payload, painted on the quad the payload's own frame describes.
 *
 * Every arithmetic decision this picture rests on -- which byte belongs to
 * which sample, how a value becomes a colour, how wide the quad has to be for a
 * texel's centre to land on its sample -- lives in `src/scene/sliceTexture.ts`
 * and is pinned there without a renderer. What is left here is the wiring that
 * genuinely needs three: a `DataTexture`, a `PlaneGeometry`, a rotation, and
 * the disposal of all three.
 *
 * Three of the four texture settings below -- the two filters and `flipY` --
 * are three@0.185.1's own `DataTexture` defaults, and are written out anyway. A
 * default is a fact about a dependency's version, not a decision this scene has
 * made, and each is load-bearing: a minor upgrade that changed one would
 * silently change the physics the picture asserts, with no diff anywhere in
 * this repo. The fourth, `colorSpace`, is a departure from the default rather
 * than a restatement of it. Their reasons are on the lines themselves.
 *
 * Two shapes here are dictated by react-three-fiber rather than by three, and
 * both were measured rather than guessed:
 *
 * **The material is an object, not a `<meshBasicMaterial>` child.** r3f's
 * `applyProps` auto-tags any RGBA8 texture assigned to a `map` prop with
 * `SRGBColorSpace` whenever the root is not `linear` (events-*.js: the
 * `colorMaps` list), overwriting whatever this module set -- measured: the
 * texture came back tagged `"srgb"` however it was declared here. That tag now
 * happens to be the one this colormap wants, which is exactly why the material
 * still has to be owned rather than declared: a colour space the renderer
 * picked from the root's linear flag is a coincidence, not a decision, and the
 * next person to read this file could not tell which it was. Owning the
 * material keeps `map` out of r3f's reach and costs one more `dispose`.
 *
 * **The rotation is handed over as an array.** r3f copies a value onto
 * `mesh.quaternion` only when `target.constructor === value.constructor`, and
 * three is loaded twice in this process (r3f's CJS bundle, this module's ESM
 * one), so a `Quaternion` instance fails that test, falls through to a plain
 * assignment, and throws on `Object3D`'s read-only `quaternion`. An array goes
 * through `fromArray` and is copy-safe across both.
