/**
 * Colour maps for the slice renderer.
 *
 * A slice plane shows one of three things about the wavefunction, and each
 * needs a different kind of map (dataviz colour formula, "the four jobs"):
 *
 *   - phase, which is cyclic -> the phase wheel, unchanged;
 *   - a signed real amplitude, whose job is POLARITY -> a diverging map, two
 *     hues with a neutral midpoint;
 *   - a probability density, whose job is MAGNITUDE -> a sequential map, one
 *     hue, monotone lightness.
 *
 * All three are built out of `phaseToRgb`, which stays the single definition of
 * the app's colour language: the diverging poles ARE two points on that wheel,
 * bit for bit, and the sequential ramp's chroma peak is a third. Nothing here
 * introduces a colour the rest of the app does not already show, so a reader
 * who has learned "red is +, cyan is -" from an orbital keeps that reading on a
 * slice.
 *
 * What these maps deliberately do NOT claim: perceptual uniformity. Nothing
 * here is computed in a perceptual space, so the sequential ramp promises
 * monotone relative luminance -- measured in sliceColor.test.ts against the
 * WCAG transfer function -- and no more than that.
 *
 * A=0 (zero amplitude) is the shared floor: the phase of a zero amplitude is
 * undefined, so the phase wheel says nothing meaningful there and the caller
 * must fade to SLICE_NEUTRAL_RGB, which is exactly what both other maps paint
 * at zero. Masked samples are a different case and are not this module's: they
 * read as `null` through `sliceValueAt` and must be filtered before a value
 * reaches a colour map at all.
