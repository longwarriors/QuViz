/**
 * What this application can actually draw, cell by cell.
 *
 * The UI used to decide "can I render this?" in three unrelated places -- a
 * store predicate, a disabled attribute, a fetch branch -- and each of them
 * knew a different, smaller part of what src/quviz/api/routes.py accepts. The
 * store's streamline predicate, for instance, tested only `basis === 'complex'
 * && m !== 0` and cheerfully asked the server for n = 8, which the route
 * rejects at n > 6: the user got a red error where the honest answer was "this
 * state is outside the route's range".
 *
 * So the matrix lives here, once, transcribed from the route signatures, and
 * every consumer reads the same answer. Two refusals, deliberately distinct:
 *
 *   `unsupported`      the physics or the server says no. Asking harder will
 *                      not help; the cell is closed and we can say why.
 *   `not_implemented`  nothing says no. We simply never built it, and saying
 *                      "unsupported" there would be a false statement about
 *                      the physics.
 *
 * The static overlay near the end of this file adds a third, `not_precomputed`,
 * on the GitHub Pages build only: the route would answer, but the precomputed
 * catalogue holds no answer for this exact request.
 *
 * Bounds below are transcribed from routes.py -- the numbers are the route's,
 * not the control panel's, because the route is what answers the request.
 * `step` is the only UI-side value here: an increment for a slider, never a
 * constraint the server imposes.

 * The static (GitHub Pages) build answers from a precomputed catalogue, and

 * never instead of them:
 *
 *   1. a refusal the routes or the physics make stays that refusal -- only its
 *      wording loses the `/api/...` paths, which name nothing on a site with
 *      no API;
 *   2. a cell the catalogue specification (spec.json) never covered becomes
 *      `not_precomputed`, with a reason naming the limit;
 *   3. every tunable the catalogue fixed is pinned `min = max` at the value the
 *      live UI would have sent for the specification's default, so the store's
 *      clamps, the panel and the planner all hold the one exported value; the
 *      superposition clock offers the exported frames as `values`;
 *   4. `planSceneRequest` refuses any concrete request whose literal key the
 *      manifest lacks (`STATIC_MISS_REASON`).
 *
 * Every `not_precomputed` reason opens with `NOT_PRECOMPUTED_DETAIL` verbatim,
 * so what a reader sees for "not in the catalogue" is one sentence wherever it
 * comes from: this planner, a spec limit, or the static transport's 404.
