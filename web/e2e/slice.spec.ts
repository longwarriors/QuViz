/**
 * What a plane section actually looks like -- the five pictures this feature
 * exists to draw, each pinned to a committed PNG.
 *
 * Everything else in the suite tests the numbers. `sliceContract.ts` proves a
 * payload is internally consistent, `sliceTexture.ts` proves a sample becomes
 * the right texel, `camera.ts` proves the viewpoint is the plane's. None of
 * them can see the one thing a user does: the picture. A renderer that reads
 * the grid transposed, mirrors v, decodes the colormap twice or drops the mask
 * passes every one of those tests and draws a physically false image -- and
 * each of those failures is *plausible-looking*, which is why nobody catches it
 * by eye either.
 *
 * So the five cases below are chosen to be pictures where a specific mistake is
 * VISIBLE and nothing else in the suite would see it:
 *
 *   2pz-real-xz          the nodal line of 2p_z on xz is the xy plane, i.e.
 *                        v = 0, i.e. a HORIZONTAL line on screen. A u/v swap
 *                        turns it vertical; a |value| colormap erases it.
 *   2p+1-phase-xy        one full counter-clockwise winding of the phase, with
 *                        the origin masked. A mirrored normal reverses the
 *                        winding; an ignored mask fills the hole with the
 *                        sentinel's colour (phase 0, "positive real").
 *   degenerate-*-xz      2s + 2p_z share E = -1/8 Ha, so |Psi|^2 cannot move.
 *                        The SAME baseline is asserted at t = 0 and t = 8.4:
 *                        the animation's negative control.
 *   1s2pz-t0 / -t8.4     1s + 2p_z beat at omega = 3/8 Ha. Two baselines half a
 *                        Bohr period apart: the positive control the negative
 *                        one is only meaningful against.
 *
 * The bytes behind every one of them are committed (`tests/fixtures/visual/`,
 * served by `./fixtures`), so a diff here is about rendering and never about a
 * server that answered differently today.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HOW THE BASELINES GET HERE. Read this before changing or adding one.
 *
 * Five Linux/SwiftShader PNGs are committed in `e2e/__screenshots__/`. The
 * canvas is full-bleed: every file is 1280 x 800 = 1024000 pixels, so the
 * 0.001 ratio budget is 1024 pixels. Every floating panel carries
 * `data-chrome`; `hideChrome` hides all of them immediately before each
 * capture, so a panel's glass and text can never leak into a canvas pixel.
 *
 * playwright.config.ts refuses to load off Linux because any other graphics
 * stack renders different pixels. Committing a PNG drawn elsewhere would make
 * the suite permanently red in CI and permanently meaningless everywhere
 * else. A new baseline therefore enters through two CI runs:
 *
 *   1. Its first run FAILS, by design. `updateSnapshots: 'none'` makes a
 *      missing baseline an error rather than a silently written answer key, so
 *      the new assertion reports "A snapshot doesn't exist at ...". The
 *      run's failure artifact carries what it actually rendered, as
 *      `test-results/<test>/<name>-actual.png`.
 *   2. A human looks at those images -- that is the whole point of step 1;
 *      the node line has to be horizontal, the winding counter-clockwise, the
 *      masked disc a hole -- and commits them to
 *      `e2e/__screenshots__/slice.spec.ts/<name>.png`.
 *   3. The second run must pass. If it does not, the renderer is not
 *      deterministic and the suite has found a real defect before it ever had
 *      a baseline: a picture that differs from the one drawn minutes earlier in
 *      the same environment is not something to paper over with a threshold.
 *
 * STEP 3 USED TO BE EXPECTED TO FAIL, and the measurement is kept here because
 * it is what the fix has to be judged against. The scene as first written did
 * not settle to a repeatable camera: driving the 2p_z path below six times in
 * one browser, waiting on `data-scene-ready` and the ready status exactly as
 * these tests do, produced six DIFFERENT settled renderings -- each perfectly
 * stable within its own run (identical again 2.5 s later), and visibly
 * different between runs: some face-on to the section, some still at the
 * default three-quarter view. That was `aimCamera`'s imperative placement
 * racing drei's `Bounds` fit -- `OrbitControls`' damping was blamed alongside
 * it, which turned out to be wrong and is what the correction below is about
 * -- and it was upstream of everything here: no wait a harness can perform
 * fixes a scene that has genuinely stopped moving in the wrong place.
 * (Measured on Windows/ANGLE, but the race was in JavaScript, not in the
 * rasteriser, so SwiftShader would show it too.)
 *
 * REDUCED MOTION WAS ONCE CREDITED WITH FIXING THAT, AND IT DID NOT.
 * src/components/OrbitalCanvas.tsx does read `(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
 * and, for a viewer who has asked for it, collapse the fit to
 * `maxDuration={0}` and turn `OrbitControls`' damping off; that is the
 * accessibility behaviour on its own terms, the same code path runs for every
 * such viewer whether or not anybody is taking screenshots, and
 * playwright.config.ts sets `reducedMotion: 'reduce'` on every context, so it
 * is the path these tests exercise. What it removes is the easing curve and the
 * damping tail -- the two things that could be sampled part-way through. What
 * it does not remove is the race, because the race was never about how LONG the
 * fit took. It was about what the fit had been aimed at.
 *
 * The mechanism, named properly. `Bounds` is mounted with `observe`, so it runs
 * fits of its own -- one from its mount, one on every canvas resize -- and each
 * captures a goal position and rotation from wherever the camera is AT THAT
 * MOMENT, then lands them from a `useFrame` one or more frames later.
 * `FitOnAssetChange` aims the camera imperatively but defers its own
 * `refresh().clip().fit()` to a `requestAnimationFrame`, and r3f's loop runs
 * before that callback. So a goal captured BEFORE the aim lands AFTER it,
 * writing the stale position and quaternion back over the aim -- and leaving
 * `up` alone, because a `Bounds` goal carries no `up` at all. The deferred
 * `refresh()` then measures the camera where the stale goal left it, and the
 * direction nobody chose is fitted to the right distance and kept. Collapsing
 * the durations only narrows the window; it does not close it, which is why
 * SwiftShader -- where a frame of this scene is expensive -- still lost the
 * race that Windows/ANGLE wins every time.
 *
 * MEASURED, not inferred, in both environments. Mounting the xz slice scene
 * under `@react-three/test-renderer` and reading the camera after 240 frames
 * instead of at the commit (src/components/OrbitalCanvas.test.tsx, "holds the
 * slice's pose once the frames have run") put the settled camera at
 * (19.2135, 11.5281, 23.0562) -- exactly 1.9214 times the `<Canvas>`'s own
 * opening position (10, 6, 12) -- with `up` still (0, 0, 1). The first CI
 * bootstrap drew that same pose: the parallelogram in its `1s2pz-t8.4-xz`
 * image has screen edge vectors in the ratio 1.158, against 1.174 predicted
 * for (10, 6, 12) with up (0, 0, 1) and 1.002 for the three-quarter default of
 * `cameraDirectionFor`. The pose CI settled at is the opening camera wearing
 * the section's own up, which is precisely what the repro produces.
 *
 * The fix is one line, and it is in the aim rather than in this suite:
 * `FitOnAssetChange` calls `bounds.refresh()` BEFORE it aims. `refresh()`
 * clears every field of the pending goal, so a fit in flight lands as a no-op
 * and the aim is the last word before the next fit is computed; a fit started
 * after the aim measures the aimed pose and is correct by construction.
 *
 * So step 3 is expected to pass -- on a stated mechanism now, rather than on a
 * hope about durations. If it still fails, that is a further defect of the same
 * kind, and the answer is the one it always was: find what is still moving. Do
 * not widen the budget. And note that the five images the first bootstrap
 * produced are NOT the baselines: that run predates both this fix and the
 * slice's fog fix (src/scene/SliceField.tsx), and every one of them is wrong.
 *
 * The three `.not.toHaveScreenshot` assertions (half-period, transposition and
 * geometry controls) never own or generate a baseline: each references one of
 * the five positive baselines above. Their per-pixel bars are at least as
 * tolerant as the positive tests' bar, deliberately: for a negated screenshot
 * assertion, a LOWER threshold makes the assertion easier to satisfy and
 * therefore weaker. Each reject budget below keeps a measured or geometric
 * margin while making its mechanism control harder to pass than a positive
 * baseline.
 *
 * `npm run test:visual:update` is not part of this procedure. It writes every
 * baseline from whatever was just rendered, which is how a bug becomes the
 * answer key; scripts/assert-visual-run.mjs refuses the report such a run
 * produces.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Three rules the tests below follow, each because the alternative silently
 * weakens the evidence:
 *
 * **Only the canvas is compared.** The scene is WebGL; every panel is a DOM
 * element floating over it and carries `data-chrome`. `hideChrome` hides them
 * all (inline visibility, so layout and text stay in the DOM for the semantic
 * assertions) right before a capture, and `revealChrome` restores them when a
 * test drives the controls again. Playwright masks are deliberately not used:
 * a mask paints its locator's live bounding box into the PNG, so font-metric
 * differences make the mask itself a cross-platform pixel diff.
 *
 * **Nothing waits on a timer.** The scene says when it has stopped moving
 * (`data-scene-ready`, see src/scene/SceneReady.tsx) and the status bar says
 * whether what is on screen is the frame that was asked for. A `waitForTimeout`
 * here would be choosing between a race and a tax on every green run.
 *
 * **The clock is set through the panel, not waited on.** The instant under test
 * is t = 8.4 a.u. `TIME_BOUND` (src/api/capability.ts) gives the time pill's
 * number input a 0.2 a.u. increment from min = -1000, so both the initial
 * t = 0 and t = 8.4 are points on the browser's native step grid.
 * `advanceToHalfPeriod` asserts that contract on the real DOM before it fills
 * the input; no attribute or store bypass is permitted. Everything downstream
 * is the app's own path: React's onChange, the store, the query and the
 * returned texture.
 *
 * WHY NOT PLAYBACK, AND WHY NOT A FAKE CLOCK. Playback reaches 8.4 honestly --
 * it steps 0.6 a.u. every 420 ms from the store's initial 0, and the fourteenth
 * tick is exactly 8.4 -- but stopping it there is a race with a 420 ms window.
 * The 0.2 slider grid also contains every playback tick because 0.6 is three
 * slider increments, so playback can never leave the thumb between steps.
 * `page.clock` made those fourteen ticks deterministic and is what this suite
 * used until its first CI run, where it cost every screenshot taken after it:
 * the clock fakes `requestAnimationFrame` too, `toHaveScreenshot`'s stability
 * phase polls the element's box across rAF callbacks, and so each capture
 * following a `pauseAt`/`runFor` starved for its full 30 s and timed out --
 * a `resume()` before the capture did not revive it. The one screenshot taken
 * with the clock merely installed passed, which is what identifies the pause
 * rather than the install as the cause.
